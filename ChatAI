#### Python Pandas how can I use standard  deviation to determine what values are outlier? 

You can use the std() method in Pandas to calculate the standard deviation of a column in a DataFrame. 
To determine which values are outliers, you can then compare each value in the column 
to the mean (calculated with the mean() method) plus or minus a certain number of standard deviations (e.g. 3).
Any value that falls outside of this range can be considered an outlier.

* Here is an example of how you can do this:

```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

col_name = 'your_column_name'
mean = df[col_name].mean()
std = df[col_name].std()
outliers = df[(df[col_name] < mean - 3*std) | (df[col_name] > mean + 3*std)]
print(outliers)
